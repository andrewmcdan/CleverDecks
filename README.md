Intro to SWE Group 4 Project

## TODO's (in no particular order)
1. Complete each of the support classes in the /index.js file.
2. Finish all the server endpoint code. 
3. ChatGPT interfacing and related classes
4. Work on the various web pages. Pages to work on:
- /web/index.html - The main landing page. Probably needs to include something to let the user know if ChatGPT is enabled and let them add their OpenAI API key if needed.
- /web/create.html - A page for creating flash cards. Need to include functions for using ChatGPT to generate cards as well as manually creating cards. 
- /web/study.html - The flash card study page. 
- /web/quiz.html - The quiz page.
